This is an app meant to balance work and break time.
This is my first all code project (ie not a game made in a game engine) so apologes for any bugs.


Commandline useage:
Launch the program with "python3 /FilepathForTheProgram/cl-app.py".
Enter how much time (in minutes) you want to work for.
Enter how much time (also is minutes) you want to take a break for.
Enter work cycles, this refers to how many times you want to work 3 cycles = work periods.
Decide if you want to take your break first or work first.
Put an end message if you want too.

Gui app useage:
At the time of me writing this the gui app does not work and I haven't decided exactly how I want it to work and look.
